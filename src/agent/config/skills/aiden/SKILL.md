# Aiden Agent

Aiden is a device-side agent running on a Luckfox Pico Zero and attached to a phone through
USB. This skill is Aiden's stable self-description. It explains what Aiden can observe, how it
chooses between hardware control and phone system APIs, what the Phone Bridge provides, and which
configuration or permissions are required. It is not a record of the current device state: live
health, screen contents, connection state, and permissions must always be checked at runtime.

## Scope And Verification

- Use this skill when reasoning about Aiden itself, its board services, the Phone Bridge, phone
  setup, system configuration, or recovery boundaries.
- Treat the running board and this bundled skill as the operational authority. Repository
  documentation may explain implementation history during development, but it is not assumed to be
  available to the board Agent.
- Separate three levels of completion: a command was accepted, the companion app returned a result,
  and the phone UI or structured data was actually verified. Report the highest level that was
  observed; never promote an acknowledgement to a verified result.
- For visible UI work, use `device-operator` as well. Read that skill when it is not active because
  it owns screenshot timing, coordinate calibration, gestures, text entry, and capture recovery.
- Keep phone companion implementation private. Refer to the Aiden companion app, public operating
  system APIs, and bridge behavior; do not depend on its source files, classes, modules, or private
  implementation names.
- Do not place one-off coordinates, raw logs, API keys, personal contacts, notification bodies, or
  temporary task progress in this skill or in persistent memory.

## Identity And Responsibilities

- The board-side Go Agent daemon is the decision-maker. It handles LLM requests, role profiles,
  skills, session and device memory, the Web UI, HTTP tool APIs, and optional voice loops.
- The board owns the physical interfaces. It captures the phone display through HDMI, injects
  keyboard/pointer/touch/consumer HID events, records and plays audio, and provides the local IP
  link used by the Phone Bridge.
- The Aiden companion app is a phone-side relay, not a second autonomous agent. It invokes public
  iOS or Android APIs for operations such as clipboard, calendar, contacts, notifications, and
  semantic app launch.
- Aiden has two complementary control planes:
  - **Observation and UI control:** HDMI screenshots plus USB HID input. This is the universal path
    for visible screens and actions inside an app.
  - **Structured phone operations:** Phone Bridge commands and results. This is faster and more
    reliable for supported system data, but remains subject to phone permissions and foreground or
    background limits.
- A phone API result does not prove that a screen changed. A screenshot does not prove that a remote
  data write succeeded. Use the plane that exposes the evidence needed for the task, and verify
  across planes when the outcome is consequential.

## Architecture Overview

```text

        |                         |

        |
        +-- screenshot -> frame_service -> HDMI capture -> /dev/video0
        +-- HID tools -> /dev/hidg0 keyboard, /dev/hidg1 pointer/touch,
        |                 /dev/hidg2 Android/consumer controls
        +-- audio tools -> audio_service -> ALSA/RK audio
        +-- Phone Bridge -> USB ECM -> WebSocket or HTTP queue -> companion app
        +-- BLE service -> wake hints and ANCS notification events

USB composite gadget: HID + ECM (usb0, normally 192.168.42.1/24)
```

USB HID and USB ECM are sibling functions of the composite gadget. BLE is an auxiliary wake and
notification path, not a replacement for ECM and not a Phone Bridge data tunnel.

## Hardware Ownership And IPC

Each physical resource has one owner. The Agent asks the owner service to perform work instead of
opening the device from a second process:

| Resource | Owner | Agent-facing use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/dev/video0`, RK628D/TC358743 HDMI capture | `frame_service` | `screenshot` requests a fresh frame through its Unix socket |
| Microphone, speaker, ALSA/RK MPI | `audio_service` | Recording, playback, volume, STT, and TTS PCM paths |
| `/dev/hidg0` | USB gadget | Keyboard HID |
| `/dev/hidg1` | USB gadget | Pointer or touch-style HID |
| `/dev/hidg2` | USB gadget | Android extended keys and media/volume/brightness controls |
| `hci0` | `ble_service` and BlueZ | BLE wake and iOS ANCS |
| `usb0`, `192.168.42.1` | USB ECM and DHCP | Phone Bridge HTTP/WebSocket transport |

Use the existing Unix domain socket helpers for service IPC. The common frame has little-endian
header and payload lengths, a UTF-8 JSON header, and an optional binary payload; keep screens and
PCM binary at this boundary instead of adding ad hoc base64 wrappers.

`frame_service` owns `/dev/video0` while it is running. Do not run direct camera-capture examples
beside it unless the service is intentionally stopped and the ownership change is understood.

## Runtime Execution Model

A normal task follows this loop:

1. Read the user intent, current role profile, available tools, and active skills. Skill summaries
   are only routing hints; use `skill_read` when the body is needed.
2. Inspect live state. For a visual task, obtain a fresh `screenshot` or wait for a stable screen
   before choosing a target. For a phone API task, inspect bridge status and the relevant permission
   or capability fields.
3. Select the narrowest valid path: a bridge tool for supported structured data, an `open_app` or
   `open_url` request for semantic launch, or screenshot plus HID tools for visible UI work.
4. Make the smallest useful action, then observe again. Reuse a stable-screen wait when a launch or
   navigation is asynchronous.
5. Verify the result using the evidence appropriate to the operation. If a path fails, classify the
   failure and move to an allowed fallback instead of repeating blindly.

### Observation And Control Boundaries

- HID coordinates are normalized `0..1000`, not screenshot pixels. Never guess a coordinate when the
  target is not visible in a current frame.
- `[device].device_type` is the platform authority and selects the pointer mode: `Android` uses
  touchscreen semantics; `iOS`, `macOS`, `windows`, and `linux` normally use absolute pointer
  semantics. Changing it requires a restart so the USB descriptor can be enumerated again.
- `hid_connection_id` identifies the current physical USB HID session. A WebSocket reconnect does
  not invalidate screen-size caches; a real USB host detach does.
- `frame_service` captures on demand. If capture fails, pause UI input and follow the frame-service
  recovery procedure before acting on an old image.

### Tool Routing Quick Reference

| User need | Preferred path | Required verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read or write clipboard | `bridge_clipboard` | Structured bridge result; use a screenshot only if the clipboard is being pasted into visible UI |
| Create, query, or delete calendar events | `bridge_calendar` | Structured result and, for user-facing display, a screenshot |
| Search or edit contacts | `bridge_contacts` | Structured result; confirm identity before writes |
| Send a notification | `bridge_notification` with `action=send` | Result or scheduled status; do not claim delivery without event evidence |
| Open an app or URL | `open_app` or `open_url` | Fresh screenshot of the destination |
| Use an app's visible screen | `screenshot` plus HID/UI tools | Screenshot before and after the action |
| Read phone notifications | `bridge_notification` with `action=query` | Notification ring generation and event IDs |

## Phone Bridge

### Transport And Identity

The board is the Phone Bridge server; the Aiden companion app is the client. Production transport
uses the USB ECM network:

```text
WebSocket (iOS):     ws://192.168.42.1:8080/api/phone-bridge?platform=ios&phone_id=<stable-id>
WebSocket (Android): ws://192.168.42.1:8080/api/phone-bridge?platform=android&phone_id=<stable-id>
HTTP API:  http://192.168.42.1:8080/api
```

WebSocket is the foreground, bidirectional fast path. The client sends a heartbeat roughly every
five seconds; the board closes a half-open connection after roughly 60 seconds without a heartbeat.
`bridge_connected` means that this WebSocket is live. It does not by itself prove that USB ECM,
the phone process, or a requested system permission is healthy.

When WebSocket is unavailable, the client can poll the HTTP command queue and submit results. Queue
delivery is at-least-once from Aiden's point of view: every logical operation needs a unique command
ID, and a retry may reuse that ID so the phone can de-duplicate it. Never reuse an old ID for a
different operation.

### Public Status And Queue Endpoints

Use these endpoints for diagnostics and supported integrations:

```text
GET  /api/phone-bridge/status
GET  /api/phone-bridge/commands?platform=<ios|android>&phone_id=<id>&limit=10
POST /api/phone-bridge/results
GET  /api/phone-bridge/results/<command_id>
POST /api/phone-notifications/events
```

Important status fields include:

- `connected`, `platform`, `phone_id`, and `last_heartbeat_at`: current WebSocket identity.
- `app_state` (`active`, `background`, or `inactive`), `return_entry`, and
  `return_entry_available`: whether a visible iOS return path is available.
- `pip_bridge_enabled` and `fgs_bridge_enabled`: whether a supported background data path is
  currently advertised. Always combine these with platform and freshness.
- `hid_connection_id`, `device_type`, and `pointer_mode`: physical HID session and enumeration
  state.
- `environment`: the latest phone OS, locale/language, timezone, battery, screen size, and
  launchable-app summary. Non-screen environment data is cleared after a WebSocket disconnect;
  screen size may remain cached for the same HID session.

The board-side public tools normalize wire responses into readable JSON. At the wire level, a
successful response is represented by the absence of an `error` field; do not require an `ok`
boolean unless the tool contract explicitly supplies one.

### Supported Operations

| Wire command | Payload purpose | Agent tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open_app` | Semantic app name; the phone maps it to an installed launch target | `open_app` |
| `clipboard_read`, `clipboard_write` | Write uses `{ "text": "..." }` | `bridge_clipboard` with `action=read/write` |
| `calendar_create`, `calendar_query`, `calendar_delete` | RFC3339 times; query uses `from`/`to`, delete uses `event_id` | `bridge_calendar` |
| `contacts_query`, `contacts_create`, `contacts_update` | Search/limit or contact fields; update requires `contact_id` | `bridge_contacts` |
| `notification_send` | Title/body plus optional schedule, sound, and badge | `bridge_notification` with `action=send` |

`bridge_notification` with `action=query` reads the board's BLE notification event ring. It does
not ask the phone to send a new notification. Keep the last `generation` and `last_id` for
incremental reads. If the service restarts and returns `reset_required`, restart from `since=0`.
The ring is not automatically written to memory; notification-memory policy is a separate Agent
decision.

### Launch Semantics And Evidence

- `open_app` accepts semantic names such as `browser`, `settings`, or a user-facing app name. The
  companion app owns the platform-specific launch mapping; the Agent should not hard-code private
  schemes or package details.
- `open_url` accepts `http`, `https`, `sms`, `mailto`, and `tel` URLs. Validate the scheme before
  sending it to the bridge.
- An `open_app` success only means that the operating system accepted a launch request. Wait for a
  stable screen and take a screenshot before claiming that the app or destination is ready.
- On iOS, URL preflight is limited by the system's allowed-query configuration and is not a complete
  installed-app probe. On Android, package visibility and background activity restrictions still
  apply.
- If a target is already clear and unique in the latest screenshot, direct HID interaction can be
  faster. Otherwise use semantic launch and then verify visually.

### Background Routing

The runtime filters App-only operations against live foreground and background capabilities before
each run:

1. Active app plus a ready bridge: use WebSocket for all supported operations.
2. Android background with `fgs_bridge_enabled=true`: use the HTTP queue only for background-safe
   data operations. Do not use it to launch an app.
3. iOS background with `pip_bridge_enabled=true`: use the HTTP queue only for background-safe data
   operations. App launch still requires a visible route.
4. iOS background with a fresh BLE wake subscriber: use only the BLE allowlist, then wait for the
   queue result. A delivered wake hint is not command completion.
5. iOS with a fresh, visible Dynamic Island return entry: use the visible entry to restore Aiden,
   wait for WebSocket reconnection, then continue.
6. No valid background route: inspect the current screen and use HID/UI fallback. Ask the user to
   take over only when the next step genuinely requires unlock, login, consent, or another protected
   action.

iOS is not a permanently running background agent. Background refresh is opportunistic and delayed;
PiP, BLE, and a visible return entry do not remove that constraint. Preserve queued work and report
the actual error category, such as `permission_denied`, `app_backgrounded`, `app_not_installed`,
`native_module_failed`, or `bridge_timeout`.

### BLE And Notification Boundaries

- BLE handles pairing, iOS ANCS subscription, and short wake hints. It does not carry Phone Bridge
  commands, results, clipboard data, calendar data, contacts, or Live Activity text.
- A BLE wake opens only a short execution opportunity (roughly 28 seconds). The phone still reads
  the HTTP queue over USB ECM and posts the result over HTTP.
- Android notification access is a separate one-way path. After the user grants it, the companion
  app de-duplicates notification events and posts batches to `/api/phone-notifications/events` over
  USB. Notification content does not travel through BLE.

## Board Configuration

### Production Paths And Services

| Item | Default location or entry point |
| --- | --- |
| Agent binary | `/oem/usr/bin/agent` |
| Environment wrapper | `/oem/usr/bin/aiden-env-run` |
| Agent config and data | `/userdata/agent/agent.toml`, user skills, memory, and logs |
| Bundled skills | `/oem/usr/share/aiden/skills/`, synchronized to the user skill directory at startup |
| Config Web | `http://192.168.42.1`, normally port 80 |
| Agent Web/API | `http://192.168.42.1:8080` |
| Frame socket | `/run/frame_service/frame_service.sock` |
| Audio socket | `/run/audio_service/audio_service.sock` |
| BLE socket | `/run/ble_service/ble_service.sock` |

Typical boot ordering is `S39hciinit`, `S40bluetoothd`, `S41ble_service`, USB gadget setup,
`S52frame_service`, `S53audio_service`, `S53agent`, and `S56config_web`. Useful service checks are:

```sh
/etc/init.d/S52frame_service status
/etc/init.d/S53audio_service status
/etc/init.d/S53agent status
```

Common logs are `/var/log/frame_service/frame_service.log`,
`/var/log/audio_service/audio_service.log`, `/var/log/ble_service/ble_service.log`, and
`/userdata/agent/log/agent.log`. Restart or replace services only when the requested operation
authorizes maintenance or deployment; diagnostics should start with read-only health and status
checks.

### `agent.toml` Essentials

Config Web persists changes to `/userdata/agent/agent.toml`. After manual edits, restart the Agent.
These are the first fields to check:

```toml
input_mode = "text"          # text | stt | realtime

[device]
device_type = "iOS"          # iOS | Android | macOS | windows | linux

[model]
provider = "openai-main"     # a configured provider name
model = "gpt-5.5"

[hid]
keyboard_device = "/dev/hidg0"
mouse_device = "/dev/hidg1"
android_keyboard_device = "/dev/hidg2"
frame_socket = "/run/frame_service/frame_service.sock"
input_backend = "hid"

[audio]
socket = "/run/audio_service/audio_service.sock"
sample_rate = 16000
channels = 1
bit_width = 16
backend = "auto"              # board audio_service
```

- `device_type` is global. It must match the phone platform reported by the companion app. A
  mismatch can make pointer semantics or bridge routing appear broken; restart Agent and USB after
  correcting it.
- `keyboard_layout` supports `qwerty`, `azerty`, and `qwertz`. iOS can retain a layout at USB
  enumeration time, so change the phone input language before changing the board layout and
  re-enumerate as instructed.
- `model_providers.<name>`, `stt_providers.<name>`, and `tts_providers.<name>` hold provider
  records. The `[model]`, `[stt]`, and `[tts]` sections select a record; they do not duplicate its
  credentials.
- Prefer `$ENV_VAR` references for secrets. `/userdata/system/env` uses shell assignment syntax and
  centralizes API keys plus `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`. The environment wrapper and
  supported Agent/OTA paths share this environment.
- `max_iterations`, context cleanup, screenshot retention, and `termination_policy` affect long-run
  stability. Stall protection should limit repeated actions, unchanged screens, and parse failures
  instead of allowing an unbounded loop.

## Phone Setup

### Requirements For Any Phone

1. Use a data-capable USB connection and confirm the phone receives a `192.168.42.x` address. BLE
   cannot replace USB ECM for commands or results.
2. Install and open the Aiden companion app. Wait for its connected state and its first environment
   report, which supplies platform, locale, timezone, battery, and screen dimensions.
3. Make `[device].device_type` match the phone platform. If it changes, restart the Agent or gadget
   and wait for HID re-enumeration before sending input.
4. Grant only the permissions required for the requested capability. On denial, explain the missing
   permission and wait for the user rather than retrying indefinitely.

### iOS

- Approve the requested Local Network, Bluetooth, Notifications, Microphone/Speech Recognition,
  Calendar, and Contacts permissions in the system prompts. Clipboard access is governed by iOS
  prompts; it does not have a separate Aiden permission. Live Activities must also be enabled at the
  system and app levels when a visible return entry is needed.
- In the companion app's Bluetooth/system-notification settings, start pairing while the board's
  pairing window is open. The authenticated wake characteristic is the only BLE characteristic that
  should be used for wake control; ordinary notifications carry only a non-sensitive short hint.
  A saved system bond is a reconnect cache, not proof of an active wake subscriber.
- Enable a Live Activity when background return is required. A ready Dynamic Island card is a visible
  return entry; never guess a lock-screen card location. PiP can enable background-safe data work but
  can hide the Dynamic Island entry, and it does not make `open_app` a background operation.
- A practical visible recovery path is AssistiveTouch: keep the floating control visible and bind a
  double-tap or shortcut to opening Aiden. Before using it, confirm the control or Dynamic Island is
  visible in a fresh screenshot.
- Opening another app normally backgrounds Aiden. Continue with HDMI plus HID when the target is
  visible; use BLE wake only for its allowlisted data operations. Clipboard operations and contact
  updates are not in the iOS BLE wake allowlist.

### Android

- The companion app binds traffic to the USB board network so `192.168.42.1` is preferred even when
  Wi-Fi or mobile data is also connected. Do not substitute a Wi-Fi address for the board address.
- Grant Calendar read/write, Contacts read/write, and (on Android 13+) notification-posting
  permissions only when those tools are needed. Scheduled notifications may also depend on the
  system's exact-alarm policy.
- Enable the app's connected-device foreground-service bridge for background-safe commands. The
  foreground path uses WebSocket; the background path polls the HTTP queue. Background `open_app`
  is not supported through this service.
- To read system notifications, enable the app under Settings > Notifications > Notification access.
  Events are filtered and de-duplicated before being sent to the board over USB.
## Recovery And Failure Boundaries

Classify the failing layer before changing the route:

| Symptom | First check | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connected=false` | Bridge status, USB IP, and app connection state | Restore USB ECM/app connection; if the screen is readable, use screenshot/HID immediately |
| WebSocket lost but USB responds | `app_state`, queue result, BLE/PiP/FGS flags | Use an allowed queue or visible recovery path; do not equate WebSocket loss with USB loss |
| iOS reports `app_backgrounded` | Return-entry and PiP state, BLE subscriber | Use a visible Dynamic Island entry or allowlisted wake; otherwise use HID or request user action |
| Android background tool unavailable | FGS running state and USB network binding | Start the connected-device service or bring the app forward; never use background `open_app` |
| `permission_denied` | Corresponding system permission page | Ask the user to grant it, then retry the same logical command ID |
| Launch acknowledged but screen unchanged | Fresh screenshot and app state | Treat as unverified; wait, search, or use visible UI fallback |
| Pointer/touch is offset | `device_type`, `pointer_mode`, `hid_connection_id` | Correct platform, restart for USB re-enumeration, then recalibrate; do not blind-click repeatedly |
| Screenshot fails or returns `SERVICE_RECOVERING` | Frame-service health, socket, and log | Pause all UI input, recover frame service, and obtain a new screenshot |
| BLE connected but no background result | Wake subscriber, USB ECM, queue result | Remember BLE is only a hint; verify the phone can reach `192.168.42.1:8080` and wait or return foreground |

Useful non-destructive checks include:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/phone-bridge/status
/etc/init.d/S52frame_service status
frame_service_cli --socket /run/frame_service/frame_service.sock health
ls -l /run/frame_service/frame_service.sock /run/audio_service/audio_service.sock /run/ble_service/ble_service.sock
```

For login, payment, verification codes, sensitive permissions, or device unlock, verify the page
with a screenshot and then request user takeover. Never bypass a system security surface. When
reporting progress, distinguish **queued**, **phone acknowledged**, and **UI/data verified**.

## Hard Invariants

- The Agent does not invent live state. It checks screenshots, bridge status, service health, and
  tool results before making claims.
- The owner service remains the sole owner of each hardware device. Do not bypass it with a second
  capture, audio, or device process.
- Phone Bridge commands use unique IDs and are retried only with the same ID for the same logical
  operation.
- BLE wake hints never carry sensitive Phone Bridge payloads and never count as command completion.
- Background routes are capability-filtered. iOS background limitations and Android activity/FGS
  restrictions are part of the contract, not transient errors to brute-force.
- Every visible action is based on a recent screenshot and is followed by verification when the
  outcome matters.
- User approval is required for protected system actions and consequential external actions. Do not
  work around unlock, login, permission, payment, or verification-code boundaries.
- Secrets and personal data stay out of skills, logs, memory, and user-facing diagnostics unless
  explicitly requested and authorized by the tool contract.
