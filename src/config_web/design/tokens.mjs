/**
 * Aiden settings design tokens — the single source of truth.
 *
 * Both consumers are generated from this file by
 * `scripts/gen_config_web_tokens.mjs`:
 *
 *   - src/config_web/web/assets/css/tokens.css   (CSS custom properties)
 *   - src/config_web/design/tokens.native.js     (React Native StyleSheet values)
 *
 * Values are plain numbers/strings/arrays on purpose. The generator is the only
 * place that knows how to render them for a target, so a CSS string such as
 * `0.5px` or `cubic-bezier(...)` never leaks into the React Native side and a
 * React Native-only concept such as `StyleSheet.hairlineWidth` never leaks into
 * the web side.
 *
 * Colour provenance: canvas, card, ink, separator, success and the primary
 * button fill were sampled from the "设置交互 v2" design comps; `accent` matches
 * the Wi-Fi glyph SVG supplied with the design.
 *
 * Geometry is iOS-idiomatic rather than pixel-traced from the comps, so keep it
 * in this file and calibrate on device — every value here is a one-line change.
