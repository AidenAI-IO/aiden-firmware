# Persistent Python Packages

## Overview

The board uses the firmware-provided `/usr/bin/python3` and pip. The Agent may
install a missing dependency through its existing Shell tool; there is no
package-install tool, virtual environment, lock file, or second Python runtime.

Runtime-installed packages use pip's standard user base:

```text
/userdata/agent/python/
├── bin/
└── lib/python<major>.<minor>/site-packages/
```

`PYTHONUSERBASE` is fixed at `/userdata/agent/python`. pip naturally separates
import packages by Python version under `lib/`; package CLIs share `bin/`.

## Firmware and Startup

The pinned `pico-sdk` enables pip in both active Luckfox Buildroot defconfigs.
The SDK also carries the compatible Python dependency set required by the
firmware's existing packages. Runtime code must not upgrade the rootfs copies of
pip, setuptools, or wheel.

At Agent service startup, `S53agent` prepares:

| Path | Mode | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/userdata/agent/python` | `0755` | Persistent pip user base |
| `/userdata/tmp` | `01777` | Disposable pip download and extraction data |

The Go runtime validates the same paths before enabling the Shell temporary
directory override. Symlinks are rejected when used as either managed root.

## Environment

`/etc/profile.d/aiden-python.sh` exports the shared Python environment:

```text
PYTHONUSERBASE=/userdata/agent/python
PIP_USER=1
PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1
PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
```

Login shells source this profile normally. `aiden-env-run` sources it after
`/userdata/system/env`, so conflicting values from that file are overwritten
before the Agent service starts. Agent and manual user shells therefore use the
same package environment.

`TMPDIR` is not global. The Agent Shell adds only:

```text
TMPDIR=/userdata/tmp
```

This applies to foreground, background, and PTY commands and keeps pip work out
of the small `/tmp` tmpfs without redirecting temporary files for every service.

## Installing and Using Packages

The Agent prompt tells the model to prefer the standard library and installed
packages. When installation is necessary, it should use one exact top-level
version, require a wheel, and verify the resulting environment:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --only-binary=:all: 'packaging==24.2'
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip check
```

`pip check` should use a bounded Shell timeout of at least 120 seconds. The
Agent should avoid installation while `/run/agent/storage_level` is not
`normal` or `/userdata` is visibly low on space.

Python imports use the managed user site automatically:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 script.py
```

Package CLIs are not added to the global `PATH`. Add the user-base `bin`
directory only for the invocation that needs it:

```bash
PATH="$PATH:$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin" package-command
```

Direct pip installation is intentionally non-transactional. Failed installs may
leave partial package files; the Agent should inspect the error and report or
retry with another exact compatible version rather than loop indefinitely.

## StorageMonitor Cleanup

StorageMonitor registers the `python_userbase` cleaner.

Normal and manual force cleanup:

- Remove direct children of `/userdata/tmp` older than 24 hours.
- Remove stale symlinks themselves without following their targets.
- Preserve recent temporary entries because they may belong to a running pip
  command.
- Preserve everything under `/userdata/agent/python`.

Emergency cleanup runs only while the effective storage level is `emergency`:

- Clear `/userdata/agent/python` and recreate it as an empty `0755` directory.
- Continue using the 24-hour rule for `/userdata/tmp`.
- Remove installed third-party packages; imports and package CLIs remain
  unavailable until the packages are reinstalled.

Manual `force=true` at a lower storage level does not clear the user base.

Manual cleanup can target the cleaner through the existing API:

```json
{
  "force": false,
  "targets": ["python_userbase"]
}
```

## Reboot and OTA

Packages persist across reboot and A/B rootfs updates because they live on
`/userdata`. If an OTA keeps the same Python major/minor version, compatible
packages remain importable. A different Python version uses a different
`lib/python<major>.<minor>/site-packages` directory under the same user base;
old files remain until Emergency cleanup.

The shared `bin/` directory is not versioned. If a package CLI becomes
incompatible after OTA, reinstall that package before using the CLI.

## Limitations

- Downloaded packages execute with the Agent's privileges; exact versions and
  wheels do not make an untrusted package safe.
- The feature does not install system libraries or build source distributions.
- A user package can shadow a firmware Python package because both Agent and
  user shells share `PYTHONUSERBASE`.
- The MVP has no package lock, installation mutex, rollback, quota, manifest,
  or separate package database.
- Concurrent Agent and manual SSH pip operations are unsupported.

## Verification

Host coverage verifies environment inheritance, directory permissions, Shell
TMPDIR propagation, cleanup levels, symlink safety, and prompt guidance.

On a board, verify the complete path with:

1. `/usr/bin/python3 -m pip --version`.
2. Install an exact wheel through Agent Shell and run `pip check`.
3. Import the package with `/usr/bin/python3` and invoke any CLI with scoped
   `PATH`.
4. Restart the Agent and confirm the package remains available.
5. Confirm normal/force cleanup preserves packages and Emergency cleanup clears
   them while leaving an empty user-base directory ready for reinstall.
