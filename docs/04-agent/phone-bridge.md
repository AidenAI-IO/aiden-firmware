# Phone Bridge

## Purpose

# Purpose

The Aiden companion app connects to the hardware board over USB ECM and executes phone-side operations available through public iOS and Android APIs.

The board remains responsible for screen observation, task planning, and HID fallback. Phone Bridge is a software fast path for operations such as launching apps, accessing the clipboard, and working with calendars, contacts, and notifications.

## Capabilities

| Capability | iOS | Android | Problem Solved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Open an app or URL | URL scheme / Universal Link / `openURL` | Package name / Intent / deep link | Avoid searching for an icon when the OS exposes a direct launch path. |
| Clipboard read/write | `UIPasteboard` | Clipboard API | Exchange text without UI-driven copy and paste. |
| Calendar | EventKit | Calendar provider | Query, create, and delete calendar events. |
| Contacts | Contacts framework | Contacts provider | Query, create, and update contacts. |
| Notification | Local notification and ANCS query | Local notification and Notification Access query | Deliver reminders and query the shared notification event ring. |
| Board communication | Foreground WebSocket with limited background recovery | Foreground WebSocket and FGS HTTP polling | Receive commands and return structured results. |

## Communication Method

The board has the fixed USB-network address `192.168.42.1`. The companion app acts as the client and connects to:

```text
Phone relay app -> ws://192.168.42.1:8080/api/phone-bridge
```

The board is the WebSocket server, so it does not need to discover the phone's DHCP address and the app does not need to expose a local server. The Agent HTTP APIs use the same port, `8080`.

The board also exposes `/api/phone-bridge/commands` and `/api/phone-bridge/results` HTTP queue endpoints, but React Native JS, WebSocket, and polling timers in the iOS background must not be treated as a general tool execution path. On iOS, Phone Bridge is normally a foreground fast path: if the Aiden app is backgrounded and the app has reported `return_entry=dynamic_island`, Agent restores the Aiden app through Dynamic Island, waits for foreground WebSocket bridge reconnection, then executes the requested tool command. Lock-screen Live Activity entries require visual confirmation rather than fixed-coordinate tapping.

PiP Bridge is a narrow exception. When the app reports `pip_bridge_enabled=true` while backgrounded, iOS gives PiP priority over the Dynamic Island, so the Dynamic Island return entry is not visible. The HTTP/Tool Lab catalog remains complete for direct diagnostics, while the conversational Agent catalog is filtered from live runtime capabilities before each run. `open_app` remains exposed because it can fall back to SearchLaunchApp; only executable background-safe data tools (`bridge_clipboard`, `bridge_calendar`, `bridge_contacts`, `bridge_notification`) are exposed through the HTTP queue, and unavailable App actions are omitted.

BLE Wake provides an on-demand iOS background route for a narrower command set: calendar create/query/delete, contacts query/create, and local notification send. Clipboard read/write is not reliable in the iOS background, and contacts update is not exposed through BLE Wake; those calls return an explicit `app_backgrounded` error unless foreground Phone Bridge, PiP, or Dynamic Island restoration provides another executable route. Before each Agent run, runtime capability filtering checks whether `ble_service` reports a connected Wake subscriber and exposes only executable tools and actions. The command is then placed in the existing HTTP queue and the board makes a best-effort `wake` call. BLE carries only the wake hint: the app polls with its `phone_id`, executes the native module, and posts the structured result over HTTP. The phone must therefore remain connected to the board's USB ECM network; BLE is not a replacement command transport. If BLE is unavailable, those App-only tools are omitted unless another route such as foreground Phone Bridge, PiP/FGS polling, or Dynamic Island restoration is usable; a failed Wake notify never removes an already queued command.

Android FGS Bridge follows the same HTTP queue contract without using WebSocket as a background transport. When the Android foreground service polls `/api/phone-bridge/commands` with `app_state=background` and `fgs_bridge_enabled=true`, the Agent keeps `open_app` unavailable and routes only background-safe data tools through the HTTP queue.

Android system-notification ingestion is a separate one-way path. After the
user grants Notification Access, the app's native listener posts bounded,
retry-safe event batches to `/api/phone-notifications/events` over USB ECM. The
Agent forwards them to the same `ble_service` event ring used by iOS ANCS;
Android does not need BLE pairing for this path.

## Desktop Agent With ADB Reverse

When running the Agent on a development computer instead of the Luckfox board, the phone cannot reach `192.168.42.1` because the USB ECM board network does not exist. For Android development, use the ADB input backend and let the phone app connect through ADB reverse:

```text
Phone relay app -> ws://127.0.0.1:8080/api/phone-bridge
ADB reverse     -> host computer 127.0.0.1:8080
```

When `[hid].input_backend = "adb"` is active, the desktop Agent attempts to configure the reverse mapping automatically at startup:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
```

The companion app keeps `192.168.42.1` as the first target, then falls back to the desktop ADB reverse target when the board API is unavailable. Android board-network binding is skipped for loopback URLs so the app can reach the ADB reverse socket.

For TTS replies in this desktop/PC Agent mode, keep `audio.playback_backend = "auto"` or set it to `"local"`. The Agent will synthesize TTS normally, wrap the PCM as a temporary WAV, and play it through the host OS player instead of `audio_service`.

## App Opening Flow

```text
Board HDMI sees screen / user issues task
        │
        ▼
AI identifies target app, e.g., "WeChat"
        │
        ▼
Look up mapping table
iOS: weixin://
Android: com.tencent.mm
        │
        ▼
Public open_app reads the live relay-app state:
If foreground Phone Bridge is ready:
    Send semantic open_app command
Otherwise:
    Use SearchLaunchApp through the visible system UI
        │
        ▼
Relay app executes:
iOS: openURL("weixin://")
Android: Intent launch package name
        │
        ├─ HDMI verification success -> continue next step
        └─ Failure / timeout -> fallback to hardware simulation: find icon coordinates + HID tap
```

## Key Boundaries

On iOS, the relay app is not a background-resident system agent. It's more like a foreground fast-path executor; Dynamic Island can be used as the automatic entry point back to the Aiden app, while lock-screen Live Activity cards need visual confirmation:

```text
Aiden app foreground
-> Receives board command
-> openURL opens WeChat
-> Aiden app enters background
-> Subsequent operations continue via hardware HDMI observation + HID operation
```

So iOS cannot promise long-term background command reception. BLE Wake adds a
short on-demand HTTP Queue window for its allowlist, but it does not make the
App permanently resident. Android can be more stable through a foreground
service, with stronger background polling capability.

## iOS Key Points

- Don't use `canOpenURL` for large-scale pre-checking.
- Directly call `openURL(url)` to attempt opening.
- `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` mainly limits `canOpenURL` queries, not dynamic `openURL` attempts.
- The companion app owns the current URL scheme/package/intent mapping; the
  board sends semantic targets.
- `openURL` returning success doesn't mean target page is fully usable; ultimately verify via HDMI visually.

## Android Key Points

- Prioritize launching by package name: `getLaunchIntentForPackage("com.tencent.mm")`.
- Android 11+ has package visibility restrictions, need to configure `<queries>`, or evaluate `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` for specific scenarios.
- Background Activity launching has system restrictions, but availability after foreground service, notifications, and user authorization is stronger than iOS.

## Companion App Implementation

The companion app is a bare React Native application. React Native owns the UI, WebSocket client, foreground command dispatch, and shared business logic. Native Swift and Kotlin/Java modules provide platform capabilities that are not exposed directly to JavaScript.

Important native areas include:

- iOS local-network permissions, URL launching, calendar, contacts, notifications, Live Activity, PiP Bridge, and BLE Wake integration.
- Android package and intent launching, package visibility, notifications, Notification Access, board-network binding, and foreground-service polling.

See the related `aiden-app` repository for the companion-app source and platform permission declarations. Its `package.json` is the source of truth for the current React Native and toolchain versions.

## Why WebSocket on Top of USB Network

USB ECM (`192.168.42.1`) and WebSocket are two layers:

| Layer | Function |
| --- | --- |
| USB ECM | Network link — enables IP packet communication between phone and board |
| WebSocket | Application protocol — transmits commands and acknowledgments on this link |

USB ECM is "road is built", WebSocket is "vehicles running on the road".

The existing `192.168.42.1:80` config page is HTTP request-response mode, suitable for human web operations. But the board needs to **actively push commands to phone app** (like "open WeChat now"), which HTTP cannot do — HTTP is client-initiated, server cannot actively talk to client.

WebSocket's core value:

- **Bidirectional real-time**: Board can push commands to app anytime, app can reply anytime
- **Long connection**: No need to rebuild connection each time, low latency
- **State awareness**: Connected means online, disconnection immediately known, triggers HID fallback

## Implemented Runtime Flow

1. The relay app connects to `ws://192.168.42.1:8080/api/phone-bridge`
   after startup and sends periodic heartbeats.
2. The app reports `phone_environment` after connection and foreground return,
   plus `phone_app_state` whenever its visible lifecycle changes. Android FGS
   Bridge reports `fgs_bridge_enabled` through HTTP queue polling.
3. The board maintains `bridge_connected`, `platform`, `last_heartbeat_at`,
   `app_state`, return-entry and background-bridge fields, plus the latest
   environment snapshot.
4. Before each conversational run, the Agent filters App-only tools and actions
   using foreground Phone Bridge, Dynamic Island restore, PiP/FGS polling, BLE
   Wake, and BLE notification-query capabilities.

`bridge_connected` only means the WebSocket is currently active. It is not equivalent to USB cable connectivity. After the iOS app enters background, WebSocket may disconnect while USB ECM remains reachable; Dynamic Island updates use a local BLE Wake followed by a USB ECM read of `/api/live-activity/current`, not the phone bridge WebSocket or a remote relay.

When `app_state=background|inactive`, `return_entry=dynamic_island`,
`return_entry_available=true`, and PiP Bridge mode is not enabled, `open_url`
and bridge data tools can click the Aiden app Dynamic Island entry, wait for Phone
Bridge recovery, then send their commands. `open_app` instead selects
SearchLaunchApp whenever foreground Bridge app launch is unavailable.
Lock-screen Live Activity entries are not blind-tapped because their screen
position is not stable; use screenshot/HID fallback or visual confirmation
instead. When `pip_bridge_enabled=true` on iOS or `fgs_bridge_enabled=true` on
Android in the background, the generic background-safe data commands use the
HTTP queue. With an authenticated iOS Wake subscriber, the narrower BLE Wake
allowlist uses that same queue after a non-sensitive GATT hint.

### Command Protocol

Board sends `BridgeCommand` to app via WebSocket, app executes and replies with `BridgeCommandResponse`.

#### Common Fields

**BridgeCommand (board → app)**:
```json
{
  "id": "cmd_001",
  "type": "open_app | clipboard_read | clipboard_write | calendar_* | contacts_* | notification_send",
  "timeout_ms": 5000,
  "payload": { }  // Optional, command-related JSON (clipboard text, calendar event, etc.)
}
```

**BridgeCommandResponse (app → board)**:
```json
{
  "id": "cmd_001",
  "method": "calendar_create",
  "data": {"event_id": "event_123"}
}
```

Failure example:

```json
{
  "id": "cmd_001",
  "error": {
    "category": "user_action_required",
    "code": "permission_denied",
    "message": "Calendar access not granted"
  }
}
```

`error` is omitted on success. The current wire schema does not include an
`ok` boolean; `method` and `data` are optional success fields.

**App Active Event (app → board)**:
```json
{
  "id": "phone_environment",
  "method": "phone_environment",
  "data": {
    "platform": "ios",
    "system_name": "iOS",
    "system_version": "18.5",
    "locale": "zh-Hans-CN",
    "time_zone": "Asia/Shanghai",
    "utc_offset": "+08:00",
    "manufacturer": "Apple",
    "model": "iPhone16,2",
    "screen": {"width_pixels": 1179, "height_pixels": 2556, "scale": 3},
    "battery": {"level": 0.87, "charging": true},
    "system_apps": [{"name": "Camera", "available": true, "category": "system", "availability_source": "builtin"}],
    "third_party_apps": [{"name": "WeChat", "available": true, "category": "third_party", "availability_source": "can_open_url"}],
    "available_apps": [{"name": "WeChat", "available": true, "category": "third_party"}]
  }
}
```

`phone_environment` does not correspond to board command ID; board only updates bridge status, won't treat it as tool call acknowledgment.
`system_apps` is system built-in app/capability list; `third_party_apps` is installation/openability probe result. `available_apps` retained only as legacy field for old boards.

#### Command Types

##### 1. `open_app` — Open App

```json
{
  "id": "open_001",
  "type": "open_app",
  "app": "微信",
  "timeout_ms": 10000
}
```

Reply:
```json
{
  "id": "open_001",
  "method": "ios_url_scheme"
}
```

App-side `method` represents the underlying mechanism (for example `ios_url_scheme`, `ios_shortcut`, `android_intent`, `android_deeplink`, `launch_package`, or `open_url`). The public `open_app` tool routes semantic app launches to the internal Phone Bridge launcher or visible system search. The public `open_url` tool sends `http`, `https`, `sms`, `mailto`, and `tel` URLs through Phone Bridge. Their results normalize task semantics into `method:"open_app"` or `method:"open_url"`, while the underlying app-side method is returned as `mechanism`.

App-launch and URL semantics are separated: call `open_app` with `{"app":"browser"}` to launch the browser itself, and call `open_url` with a supported URL such as `{"url":"https://example.com"}` or `{"url":"tel:+15551234567"}`. The companion app owns platform-specific URL/package/intent mapping.

##### 2. `clipboard_read` — Read Clipboard

```json
{
  "id": "clip_read_001",
  "type": "clipboard_read",
  "timeout_ms": 5000
}
```

Reply:
```json
{
  "id": "clip_read_001",
  "data": {
    "text": "clipboard content"
  }
}
```

##### 3. `clipboard_write` — Write Clipboard

```json
{
  "id": "clip_write_001",
  "type": "clipboard_write",
  "payload": {
    "text": "content to copy"
  },
  "timeout_ms": 5000
}
```

Reply:
```json
{
  "id": "clip_write_001",
  "method": "clipboard_write"
}
```

##### 4. `calendar_create` — Create Calendar Event

```json
{
  "id": "cal_create_001",
  "type": "calendar_create",
  "payload": {
    "title": "Dentist appointment",
    "start_at": "2026-06-02T15:00:00+08:00",
    "end_at": "2026-06-02T16:00:00+08:00",
    "all_day": false,
    "location": "Clinic",
    "notes": "Bring insurance card"
  },
  "timeout_ms": 8000
}
```

Reply:
```json
{
  "id": "cal_create_001",
  "data": {
    "event_id": "ios_calendar_id_123"
  }
}
```

##### 5. `calendar_query` — Query Calendar Events

```json
{
  "id": "cal_query_001",
  "type": "calendar_query",
  "payload": {
    "from": "2026-06-02T00:00:00+08:00",
    "to": "2026-06-03T00:00:00+08:00"
  },
  "timeout_ms": 8000
}
```

Reply:
```json
{
  "id": "cal_query_001",
  "data": {
    "events": [
      {
        "event_id": "...",
        "title": "Dentist appointment",
        "start_at": "2026-06-02T15:00:00+08:00",
        "end_at": "2026-06-02T16:00:00+08:00",
        "location": "Clinic"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### 6. `calendar_delete` — Delete Calendar Event

```json
{
  "id": "cal_delete_001",
  "type": "calendar_delete",
  "payload": {
    "event_id": "ios_calendar_id_123"
  },
  "timeout_ms": 8000
}
```

Reply:
```json
{
  "id": "cal_delete_001",
  "method": "calendar_delete"
}
```

##### 7. `contacts_query` — Query Contacts

```json
{
  "id": "contacts_query_001",
  "type": "contacts_query",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Zhang San",
    "limit": 20
  },
  "timeout_ms": 8000
}
```

Reply:
```json
{
  "id": "contacts_query_001",
  "data": {
    "contacts": [
      {
        "contact_id": "contact_123",
        "name": "Zhang San",
        "phone_numbers": ["+86 138 1234 5678"],
        "emails": ["zhangsan@example.com"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### 8. `contacts_create` — Add Contact

```json
{
  "id": "contacts_create_001",
  "type": "contacts_create",
  "payload": {
    "name": "Li Si",
    "phone_numbers": ["+86 139 8765 4321"],
    "emails": ["lisi@example.com"],
    "organization": "Company name",
    "notes": "Notes"
  },
  "timeout_ms": 8000
}
```

Reply:
```json
{
  "id": "contacts_create_001",
  "data": {
    "contact_id": "new_contact_id_123"
  }
}
```

On iOS, `notes` is ignored for contact create/update because
`CNContactNoteKey` requires an entitlement Aiden does not request. Android
supports the field.

##### 9. `contacts_update` — Update Contact

```json
{
  "id": "contacts_update_001",
  "type": "contacts_update",
  "payload": {
    "contact_id": "contact_123",
    "name": "Li Si (updated)",
    "phone_numbers": ["+86 139 8765 4321", "+86 010 1234 5678"],
    "emails": ["lisi_new@example.com"]
  },
  "timeout_ms": 8000
}
```

Reply:
```json
{
  "id": "contacts_update_001",
  "method": "contacts_update"
}
```

##### 10. `notification_send` — Send Notification

```json
{
  "id": "notification_001",
  "type": "notification_send",
  "payload": {
    "title": "Reminder",
    "body": "Time to take medicine",
    "schedule_at": "2026-06-04T18:00:00+08:00",
    "sound": true,
    "badge": 1
  },
  "timeout_ms": 5000
}
```

The public `bridge_notification` tool supports both companion-app local
notification sending and board-side shared system-notification querying:

```json
{"action":"send","title":"Reminder","body":"Time to take medicine","sound":true}
```

```json
{"action":"query","limit":20}
```

`action=send` continues to use `notification_send` through the companion app.
`action=query` reads `ble_service` directly and returns notification changes,
the current generation, and cursor fields. Omitting `since` returns the latest
retained events. Pass `since=0` to page forward from the oldest retained event;
incremental queries pass the prior `last_id` as `since` together with the prior
`generation`. Querying does not require Aiden to be foregrounded or Phone
Bridge to be connected. On iOS the
events come from ANCS; the same ring can contain Android events forwarded over
the phone-notification ingestion path when that feature is installed.

Reply:
```json
{
  "id": "notification_001",
  "data": {
    "notification_id": "notification_123"
  }
}
```

### Time Format

All time fields must be **RFC3339 format with timezone offset**, e.g.:
- `2026-06-02T15:00:00+08:00` (3pm GMT+8)
- `2026-06-02T07:00:00Z` (7am UTC)

Use the phone environment timezone when it is available. The Agent can use `shell` for a controller-time baseline, but must not assume the controller timezone matches the phone.

### Permissions and Privacy

- **Clipboard read**: iOS 16+ shows one-time authorization banner, frequent reads affect experience. Android 10+ requires foreground app or foreground service.
- **Calendar read/write**: Both iOS and Android need runtime permissions. When
  permission is denied, the response carries a structured
  `permission_denied` error; timeout is controlled by board-side `timeout_ms`.
- **Contacts read/write**: iOS needs `NSContactsUsageDescription`; Android needs
  `READ_CONTACTS` and `WRITE_CONTACTS`. Denial uses the same structured error.
- **Notification permission**: iOS requests authorization through
  `UNUserNotificationCenter`; Android 13+ needs `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`.
- **Notification reading**: Android system-notification ingestion separately
  requires the user to enable Aiden under Settings > Notification access.
  `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` alone does not grant access to other apps' notifications.

### Runtime Routing

1. `open_app` reads live companion-app state. When foreground Phone Bridge is
   ready it uses BridgeOpenApp; otherwise it uses SearchLaunchApp through the
   visible system UI.
2. `open_url` and bridge data tools may restore a backgrounded iOS Aiden app
   through a confirmed Dynamic Island entry before sending their command.
3. PiP/FGS background routes allow clipboard, calendar, contacts, and local
   notification commands through the HTTP queue. BLE Wake uses only calendar
   create/query/delete, contacts query/create, and notification send.
4. Before each conversational run, unavailable App tools and actions are
   filtered from the Agent catalog. The HTTP/Tool Lab catalog remains complete
   for direct diagnostics.
5. Bridge data tools return a clear bridge-unavailable error when no executable
   foreground, restoration, background queue, or BLE route exists.

## Control Boundary

Phone Bridge does not replace hardware control. It adds a software fast path:

```text
What can be completed quickly via software, go through relay app;
What software cannot do or is unstable, continue via HDMI + HID.
```

iOS uses a foreground fast path with limited background recovery and hardware fallback. Android additionally supports background-safe commands through foreground-service polling. In both cases, HDMI observation remains the final verification path when task completion depends on visible phone state.
