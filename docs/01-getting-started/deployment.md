# Deployment to Device

## Complete Debian Firmware

The production deployment path is a complete Debian image. Build the audited
application bundle, Debian rootfs, BSP, A/B images, and signed local OTA
metadata with:

```bash
./debian_build.sh
```

The directly flashable image is:

```text
output/debian/image/update.img
```

On Linux, flash it with the guarded helper below. It checks the image digest,
requires Loader/Maskrom mode, and makes the destructive userdata overwrite
explicit:

```bash
FLASH_TOOL=pico-sdk/tools/linux/Linux_Upgrade_Tool/upgrade_tool
IMAGE=output/debian/image/update.img
SHA256=$(awk '{print $1}' "${IMAGE}.sha256")
scripts/flash.sh inspect --tool "${FLASH_TOOL}"
sudo scripts/flash.sh flash \
  --tool "${FLASH_TOOL}" \
  --image "${IMAGE}" \
  --sha256 "${SHA256}" \
  --confirm-erase-all-data
```

The repository-root `upgrade_tool/upgrade_tool` is a macOS Mach-O binary; use
the Linux tool from the repository `pico-sdk` submodule. On macOS, flash a
locally built image with:

```bash
./upgrade_tool/upgrade_tool uf ./output/debian/image/update.img
```

The image installs these main runtime trees:
```text
/usr/lib/aiden/                                  # Audited production applications
/usr/lib/aiden/platform/lib/                                  # Vendor and application libraries
/usr/lib/aiden/models/                                # VAD model and weights
/usr/share/aiden/                          # Config Web, skills, audio, and EDID assets
/usr/lib/aiden/                                # Debian rootfs service helpers
/etc/systemd/system/aiden-*.service            # Product systemd units
/userdata/agent/agent.toml                     # External build-time Agent configuration
/userdata/debian/wifi/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf
/userdata/debian/ota/config.json               # Debian OTA factory configuration
```

The Pico Zero Debian device tree does not enable the vendor
`restart-poweroff` node. A kernel poweroff therefore follows the board's
native power-management path instead of deliberately rebooting through U-Boot.
This applies after rebuilding and flashing the BSP boot images; an existing
board keeps the device tree from its currently installed image.

`overlay-debian/` owns the Debian platform additions. The rootfs stage installs
`aiden-business`, BSP libraries and modules, and the OTA trust key. Business models
and notification sounds come from `assets/business/`. Both rootfs slots start with
the same image; no OEM filesystem is produced.

## Development Binary Update

Build and audit applications without rebuilding the firmware:

```bash
scripts/debian-apps/build-apps.sh all
```

Production binaries are under `output/debian-apps/apps/bin/`. For a temporary
device-side test, stop the owning systemd unit before replacing its binary:

```bash
ssh root@<device-ip> 'systemctl stop aiden-frame.service'
scp output/debian-apps/apps/bin/frame_service root@<device-ip>:/usr/lib/aiden/frame_service
ssh root@<device-ip> 'chmod 0755 /usr/lib/aiden/frame_service && systemctl start aiden-frame.service'
```

Use the same pattern for `audio_service`, `ble_service`, or `agent`. The Agent
binary also provides the `config-web` subcommand. Copying a binary directly mutates only the active rootfs slot and can
invalidate the factory hash expected by OTA diagnostics, so use it for short
development cycles only. Rebuild and flash a complete image for a reproducible
deployment.

`frame_service_cli` and `audio_service_cli` are included in the business package
for OTA self-checks. Other diagnostics such as `example_*` remain apps build
outputs. Copy only the tool needed for a bounded test to a directory under
`/userdata`, then remove it when the test is complete.

Do not deploy service definitions by copying individual files into `/etc`.
Rootfs helpers and systemd units are versioned with the Debian rootfs image and
must move together.

## Service Relationships

`aiden.target` groups the product services. Important ordering is expressed by
systemd dependencies rather than filename order:

1. Slot resolution and rootfs growth expose the active rootfs, userdata, and OTA partitions.
2. Userdata migration, machine identity, platform library registration, and strict environment generation complete.
3. Media, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB gadget, DHCP, and time services prepare hardware and networking.
4. Frame, audio, BLE, Agent, Config Web, adb host, and WLAN recovery services start independently.
5. The OTA health aggregator checks required local services before committing a pending slot.

Inspect the dependency graph with:

```bash
systemctl list-dependencies aiden.target
systemctl --failed
```

## Common Service Commands

```bash
systemctl status aiden-frame.service --no-pager
systemctl restart aiden-frame.service
systemctl status aiden-audio.service --no-pager
systemctl restart aiden-audio.service
systemctl status aiden-ble.service --no-pager
systemctl status aiden-agent.service --no-pager
systemctl restart aiden-agent.service
systemctl restart aiden-config-web.service
systemctl status aiden-usb-gadget.service --no-pager
```

## SSH Sessions and Shutdown Notifications

The minimal rootfs explicitly installs `libpam-systemd`. With `UsePAM yes`,
new SSH connections belong to `session-*.scope` units under `user-1000.slice`.
These scopes are stopped during shutdown. Debian's `ssh.service` retains
`KillMode=process`, so restarting the SSH listener preserves active connections.
Installing the package on an existing board only affects new logins; reconnect
before testing. No SSH service restart is needed.

Session registration alone does not restore shutdown broadcasts on this board.
Debian armhf systemd 257 is built with `-UTMP`, and OpenSSH opens its PAM session
before allocating a PTY. The resulting logind session initially has no `TTY`.
`/etc/ssh/sshrc` runs `aiden-ssh-session-tty` after allocation to register that
terminal through logind's `SetTTY` API. It runs as the login user, briefly takes
session control without forcing out another controller, then exits. No daemon
or additional Python package is needed. Connections without a PTY are skipped;
registration failures do not prevent login. The hook preserves X11 cookie setup.
Users with a custom `~/.ssh/rc` must invoke `/usr/lib/aiden/aiden-ssh-session-tty`
there, because OpenSSH uses the user hook instead of the system hook.

In a fresh interactive SSH login, verify:

```bash
cat /proc/$$/cgroup
loginctl show-session "$XDG_SESSION_ID" -p Scope -p TTY
```

Expect a `session-*.scope` cgroup and `TTY=pts/...`. Open a second SSH terminal
before testing. Run `sudo shutdown -k +1` in the second terminal and observe the
broadcast in the first, then cancel with `sudo shutdown -c` in the second.
logind excludes the terminal that requested shutdown from the broadcast.
Keep both connections open: scheduling within five minutes temporarily blocks
new logins. On systemd 257, `shutdown -k now` does not exercise the same scheduled
warning path. Both normal `shutdown` and `systemctl poweroff` support wall
broadcasts unless `--no-wall` is used.

For a real shutdown test, use `sudo shutdown now` in the second terminal and
observe the notification and SSH close in the first. Full poweroff timing still requires
serial-console observation after SSH exits; session cleanup does not prove that
USB teardown, swapoff or filesystem unmounts finish promptly. `user@1000.service`
is left enabled (about 3 MB on the tested board).

## Key Configuration Files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/aiden_boot.conf` | Product feature gates loaded by systemd units |
| `/etc/aiden_frame_service.conf` | Frame service launch and capture settings |
| `/etc/aiden_audio_service.conf` | Audio service socket and volume-state settings |
| `/etc/aiden_ble_service.conf` | BLE socket, name, event capacity, and pairing window |
| `/userdata/agent/agent.toml` | Agent runtime configuration |
| `/userdata/system/env` | Persistent device environment source |
| `/run/aiden/system.env` | Validated, generated environment consumed by services |
| `/userdata/debian/wifi/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf` | Wi-Fi configuration managed by Config Web |
| `/userdata/system/wifi-proxies.json` | Per-SSID proxy mode and optional upstream URL |
| `/userdata/debian/ota/config.json` | Debian OTA repository and factory baseline |

## Log Locations

| Service | Log |
| --- | --- |
| Frame Service | `/var/log/frame_service/frame_service.log` |
| Audio Service | `/var/log/audio_service/audio_service.log` |
| BLE Service | `/var/log/ble_service/ble_service.log` |
| adb host startup | `/var/log/adb/adb-startup.log` |
| OTA health | `/var/log/ota/ota.log` |
| Agent | `/userdata/agent/log/agent.log` |
| Wi-Fi Proxy | `/var/log/wifi_proxy/wifi_proxy.log` |

Use `journalctl -u <unit>` for systemd lifecycle and helper failures. Service
stdout/stderr that is intentionally persisted remains in the files above.

`frame_service` exclusively owns `/dev/video0`; stop `aiden-frame.service`
before a direct camera diagnostic. The Agent screenshot tool depends on the
frame service, while voice and volume tools depend on the audio service.
